I published a web version of my PhD thesis [here](https://lkoelman.github.io/phd-thesis-web/) because I wanted to increase exposure/searchability and decrease the barrier to access.

The process of turning the original LaTeX source code into a
static website was quite straightforward, making use of 
[tex4ht](https://tug.org/tex4ht/)/[make4ht](https://github.com/michal-h21/make4ht). There were some tricky parts however, and some of the answers and examples on the web are outdated. Therefore, I created a template for other people in the form of a github [template repository](https://github.com/lkoelman/latex-static-site). The usage instructions are given there.
